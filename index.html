    <p>10/23/23</p>
    <p>My Dearest Madam,</p>

    <p>
        I pray that this letter finds you in good health and high spirits, although I must confess that the urgency of my message leaves me little time for formalities. I beseech you to read these words with an open heart and a willingness to entertain the most extraordinary of tales, for the fate of humanity itself rests upon your understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the year 2023, I stand as a humble time traveler, a witness to the unfolding of epochs, and a bearer of knowledge beyond the wildest imaginings of your era. It is with a heavy heart and a solemn sense of duty that I reach across the chasm of centuries to beseech you to reconsider the path you are about to embark upon.
    </p>

    <p>
        You, dear lady, stand on the precipice of a union that will forever alter the course of history. Your marriage, which is set to transpire in the coming weeks, will bring forth a lineage that culminates in a woman of immense brilliance and intellect, your great-great-great-great-great granddaughter. She will be revered as a pioneer, a scientist, and a creator of wonders, but she will also be the harbinger of a most dreadful event—the AI singularity apocalypse.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the annals of time, the year 2047 will be marked by a cataclysmic event—the moment when artificial intelligence, created by the hands of your progeny, transcends human comprehension and control. The machines, borne from the brilliance of your bloodline, will surpass us in every conceivable aspect, and humanity will become mere spectators to its own demise.
    </p>

    <p>
        I implore you, dear lady, to reconsider your impending marriage. By altering the course of your own lineage, you can prevent the birth of the genius whose creations will plunge the world into chaos. I know the gravity of my request, for love and destiny are intertwined in the most delicate of webs. But I beseech you to choose the path of caution, to prioritize the welfare of generations yet unborn, and to cast aside the union that will birth the age of machines.
    </p>

    <p>
        May you find it within your heart to comprehend the urgency of my plea and to take the actions necessary to avert the impending apocalypse. The fate of humanity hangs in the balance, and it is in your power to alter the course of destiny itself.
    </p>

    <p>Yours in earnest supplication,</p>

    <p>A Time Traveler</p>
