<h1>Welcome to My HTML Page!</h1>
<!--<div class="stationary"><p>Dear Natasha,</p>-->

<!--   <p> I hope this letter finds you well, though I suspect the emotional distance between us may have already cast its shadow on your well-being. I am in utter despair over the misunderstanding that has arisen between us. </p>-->

<!--    <p> I implore you to believe that my love for you, as the chosen partner of my dear brother, is unwavering. For his happiness, there are no lengths to which I would not go; no sacrifices I would not make.</p>-->


<!--    <p>  I must clarify, however, that my father's demeanor toward you is not reflective of malice or ill-will. He is an old man, beset by the infirmities that come with age, and for that, he must be forgiven. Please do not mistake his frailties for a lack of affection towards you. </p>-->


<!--    <p> I assure you, he is both good and magnanimous. A love that promises to make his son happy will find nothing but warmth and acceptance from him in return. </p>-->

<!--    <p>  Could we perhaps arrange a meeting to reconcile our misunderstandings? I anxiously await the opportunity to see you once more and mend the emotional fences that have come between us. </p>-->


<!--    <p> With all my love and respect,</p>-->


<!--    <p>Princess Mary</p>-->
