        <p> My dear Natasha,</p>

        <p>You do not know me, and this letter will certainly puzzle you. But please suspend your disbelief for a moment and listen to my entreaty.</p>

        <p>I must tell you that your upcoming marriage to Sasha has to be stopped. You may wonder why. I will try to tell you, although the truth will seem as fantastical as the ramblings of a madman. I write this with the fervent hope that you will listen anyway.</p>

        <p>The truth is, after the wending of many generations, your great great great granddaughter will be born. She will have your tenacity and Sasha's proclivity for madness. And though she is a genius, she has wrought untold destruction in our time. I will explain more later.</p>

        <p>Therefore, I ask you, do not marry Sasha. Your marriage will be troubled, yes, but that is not why I ask you. I ask you to prevent the birth of the woman who will usher in the end of our civilization.</p>

        <p>Of course, I do not expect you to understand just yet. This will not be my only message. Expect me in 3 days time. I will come to you, and I will show you what I mean.</p>

        <p><strong>Yours earnestly,</strong></p>
        <p>Barnaby Miles</p>
